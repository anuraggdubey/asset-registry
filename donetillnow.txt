Got it 👍 — I’ve saved the exact point where we stopped.

Current project state remembered:

You successfully:

Upload file → generate fingerprint

Register asset on Stellar (memo REG|<hash20>)

Verify ownership page works

You opened /asset/<fileHash20> correctly (not tx hash)

Now stuck at: transfer ownership → transaction failed

We’ll continue later from debugging the transfer failure (very likely trustline / payment asset issue) — that’s the next logical blockchain step in this level.

Whenever you come back, just say:

continue stellar registry

and I’ll resume directly from the transfer debugging stage — no need to explain again 🚀
